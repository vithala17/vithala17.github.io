Right after my graduation, I have started my career at [HCL](https://www.hcltech.com/) as software engineer(2014) with .Net, C# have become my primary skills. Ever since then i always grabbed the oppurtunity the industry has thrown at me to learn and try new things. I worked on both Angular and ReactJs for some brief period, which i would say was a kind of unique experience for me. I have worked across various companies and domains like Gaming, Enterprise management applications, Finance and credit ratings, Delivery management applications, hospitality applications. I am right now employeed with Harman international, where i am working on venturing into the much anticipated devops area involving Terraform, Kubernetes, Azure pipelines and lots of other exciting stuff.

I am worked on designing *designing, developing microservices from the scratch and deploying them.* This involved delivering complex architectures patterns like event outboxing, choreographer microservices, SEDA architectures.

In the future i am looking forward for the roles where i can contribute more on implementing devops procedures and deployements, making technical designs and leading a team.

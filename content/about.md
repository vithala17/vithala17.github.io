Right after my graduation, I have started my career at [HCL](https://www.hcltech.com/) as software engineer(2014) with .Net, C# as my primary skills. Ever since then I have worked on versions of .Net ranging from **.Net framework 2** to **.Net core**, **.Net 7**. I have worked on designing the low level architecture of an application using **Microservices** in **Azure** environment, developed and deployed them. I had a chance to work on **SQL** and **SAP HANA** simultaneously as well. I would never shy away from doing things in a new way. I have minor experiences on **ReactJs** and **Angular**.  

I am worked on designing **designing, developing microservices from the scratch and deploying them.** This involved delivering complex architectures patterns like event outboxing, choreographer microservices, SEDA architectures.  

I would say my core competencies are **Microservices with .Net 7, Azure, Devops, Docker**. I have recently started working on **Kubernetes** as well.  

I practice coding on various online online platforms whenever i get some time. I have achieved a 5 star gold badge on Hackerrank problem solving segement. [Here](https://www.hackerrank.com/vithala17) is the link to it.

In the future i am looking forward for the roles where i can contribute more on implementing devops procedures and deployements, making technical designs and leading a team.

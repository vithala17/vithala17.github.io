      <description>&amp;ldquo;In a day when you dont come across any problems, you can be sure you are travelling in a wrong path&amp;rdquo; - Swami Vivekananda
Right after my graduation, I have started my career at HCL as software engineer(2014) with .Net, C# have become my primary skills. Ever since then i always grabbed the oppurtunity the industry has thrown at me to learn and try new things. I worked on both Angular and ReactJs for some brief period, which i would say was a kind of unique experience for me.</description>
